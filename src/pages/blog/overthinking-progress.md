I turned 18 two days ago and i've been reflecting on my life in general. I set some goals for this year one of which was becoming a 10X developer than I was last year. I also gained admission into the university this year and the stress has been overwhelming. I wish I had someone to tell me about the workload that comes with managing school and work.

I had to pause my webdev learning and give more attention to school cause that was essential in the early stages. Now I'm feeling unfulfilled because i know i'm not living up to my potential. As an overthinker, i spiralled into thoughts and became lethargic, my head almost imploded.
Fortunately for me, i'm surrounded with the best set of friends anyone could wish for. I got links and PDFs to jolt my learning back to life courtesy of [Oluwaseyi](https://twitter.com/xOluwaseyi "Oluwaseyi") and [Kadet](https://twitter.com/kadetXx "Kadet"). I also joined [Ayodeji](https://twitter.com/trulyao "Ayodeji") in building an amazing tool.
Ayo is a friend I really admire because we're somewhat similar and we have the same drive to truly know stuff and build flawlessly.

The point of this post is to remind myself and anyone reading that sometimes you fall behind schedule and fail to hit some goals at the time you set. It's painful I know, but the best course of action remains to pick up  the pieces and continue from where you stopped. Delay isn't denial and sometimes you might have needed that break to avoid burnout. 

The importance of having a support system is underrated, especially if you're someone who thinks a lot. You'd find yourself back on your feet quicker if you have someone who pushes you to do better. Remember 'Doing' is the keyword, just keep going. Keep coding, keep designing, keep learning and building. Whatever goal you set for yourself will come right on time and you'll celebrate it just like the champion you are.
