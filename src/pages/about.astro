        Hello, I'm Toluwalase; I'm an 18 year old Computer Science student <span class="font-thin italic">somewhere</span> in Lagos and a mostly self-taught frontend
        developer. I've always had an interest in tech from a young age but i started learning about front-end languages over a year ago. I started with frontend 
        cause I had some experience with graphic design but fullstack is the goal for me because I want to build tools for myself and other people <span class="font-thin italic">(and have some fun while at it.)</span> 
        <br />
        <br />
        I'd consider myself a partial nerd. Well for one, i'm an ambivert; an introvert and extrovert. I'm the guy that stays locked up in his room reading docs 
        and solving online coding puzzles and i'm also the guy who would have my friends burst into laughter from saying the wildest stuff.
        <br />
        I enjoy music and food. Those are two wholesome things i appreciate and the way to my heart is by creating a playlist for me and getting me my favorite snack.
        I also enjoy conversations about programming, life, mythology, and music.
